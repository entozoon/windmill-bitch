Proximity sensor for windmills in the UK.

## Troubleshooting

Device was completely silent at first, couldn't figure out why. When I checked out the raw data it wasn't getting any location info for ages. I guess the little battery needed to charge up for an hour? Or maybe.. register with the satellites or something? Who knows.

## Empirical test

It can take ages to get a lock on, but it's random:

Indoors: 30 minutes
Indoors: 5 minutes
Indoors: 10 seconds
Indoors: 10 minutes

Course toward window: 140deg
Course toward garden: 340deg
Seems legit! anti-widdershins degrees from North.
