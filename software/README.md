Proximity sensor for windmills in the UK.

## Troubleshooting

Device was completely silent at first, couldn't figure out why. When I checked out the raw data it wasn't getting any location info for ages. I guess the little battery needed to charge up for an hour? Or maybe.. register with the satellites or something? Who knows.
